Immersive Survival is a vanilla+ pack that provides a unique experience using ambient and immersive cosmetics, effects, and sounds. The modpack is survival multiplayer friendly so it can be used on your friends Vanilla servers or on many servers that you choose (use at your own risk).

- This pack is probably heavy to run! You might expect bugs or performance issues!

## Features
