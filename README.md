Built from the ground up, this modpack is a vanilla+ styled pack which features an immersive and lively experience paired with performance and utility  mods. The modpack is survival multiplayer friendly so it can be used on many servers that you choose. Inspired by my vision of survival Minecraft and the format of [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized).
#### Modpack is in ALPHA! You might expect bugs or performance issues!
## Configure features using the [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)!

- Is moody brightness not dark enough during the night? Enable the [True Darkness](https://modrinth.com/mod/true-darkness) mod to make it more terrifying! Disabled by default.
- Does your internet router support UPNP? If so, auto-magically port forward **Open to LAN** using [mcwifipnp](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcwifipnp) so your friend can join your singleplayer world!
